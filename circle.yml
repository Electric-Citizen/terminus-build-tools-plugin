#
# IMPORTANT NOTE:
#
# This is the test script for the Terminus Build Tools Plugin itself.
# You probably DO NOT want to use this as a template to emulate for setting
# up tests for other Terminus plugins or Pantheon sites.
#
# This test suite creates an entire Pantheon site (and corresponding
# Github project and Circle CI configuration) for EVERY SINGLE TEST. For
# most other projects, you will want to create your test environment once,
# and re-use it for every test.
#
# See `example.circle.yml` for a more reasonable boilerplate.
